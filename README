CloudServers API tools that build Nodes for the lbaas project.

Requires python 2.6 with paramiko
    For MacPorts users: sudo port install py26-paramiko
    For Unbuntu 10.04 users: sudo apt-get install python-paramiko


This project uses the following projects

    git://github.com/crc32a/dnsxmlserver.git for the XMLRPC controllable 
    DNS server

    git://github.com/crc32a/NodeToys.git for the NodeToys project that 
    actually gets deployed by the servers tools.





Check out the project from git hub.
git clone git://github.com/crc32a/lbaas-node-kicker.git
cd into ./lbaas-node-kicker/servers
un tar the file json.tar.gz attached to this email
tar -xvcf json.tar.gz 


run the command
./getauth cgarza.json (this has my info in it - although it says cGarza)
This creates the auth_headers.db file which stores the auth token for the lsServers script.

now run
./lsServers  xxxx This will fetch all the machines stored in the umagoring account. This part is crumby as Cloud Servers API isn't real hit or miss if it fails you may
keep re running it till it works. The script will create a file called server_list.json which is used so the genRequest script doesn't need to even hit
the CloudServers api to see what nodes are available. IE you only need to run ./lsServers once because its too painful to keep running over and over.

Edit the reqConfig.json file to you likings. You can change the quantity fields if you want. 3000 lbs may be to much for your likeings.


now run
./genRequests 
This build the requests and stores then in requests.json

Finaly run
./buildLBRequests.py lbConfig.json
This will call the api and create the loadbalancers. Edit the lbConfig.json if
you intend to hit a different end point. 
Also note that the code is going throgh the management interface and uses the extra_headers.json file to 
bypass auth.


The ./lsServers assume that servers have been created.

In order to spin up servers if servers have not been created do
To add 100 servers with password uma
./addServers 1 100 
./lsServers xxxx
./passwdservers uma 1 100
./initkick uma 1 5

//in order to see what goes into initkick script look at initkick in
